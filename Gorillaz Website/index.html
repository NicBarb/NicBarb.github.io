        <h2>The beginning of a fictional band:</h2>
        <p>Gorillaz are a British virtual band created in 1998. With Gorillaz, 
           Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop of his band Blur and explored
           influences including hip hop, electronic music, and world music through an
            "eccentrically postmodern" approach.</p>
        <p> Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, although he often collaborates 
            with many other musicians.The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and 
            Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, "If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit
             like hell â€“ there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a virtual band, 
             something that would be a comment on that." The band originally identified themselves 
             as "Gorilla" and the first song they recorded was "Ghost Train".</p>

                        days in the well known punk band Blur. In 1998, Damon had the brilliant idea of
                        making an entire band and not have people know who the members really are. Thus
                        Gorrilaz were born.The characters play parts of the band with 2-D as lead vocals and keyboards,
                         Murdoc Niccals on bass guitar, Noodle as guitarist, keyboardist, and occasional vocals,
                        and Russel Hobbs on drums and percussion.
