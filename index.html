        <h2>My Career Path and Hobbies:</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring producer. Currently enrolled at Baton Rouge Community College
           chasing an associates degree for Audio Engineering. Ever since I took a guitar class in high school
           I fell in love with music. My hobbies include finding new music, video games, and experimenting in
           a studio, learning how to further create music.</p>
